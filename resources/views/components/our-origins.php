                                    else in the world, and have earned the country the nickname, &ldquo;Land of Fire and Ice.&rdquo; Icelanders have made it a priority to preserve the unspoiled beauty of their environment&nbsp;which allows them to gift

                                <p>Long before man reached the remote island of Iceland, a massive volcanic eruption occurred, creating the &Ouml;lfus Spring deep below the earth&rsquo;s surface. For 5,000 years, water has filtered slowly through layers
                                    of lava rock,&nbsp;creating exceptionally pure and naturally alkaline water with the perfect mineral balance. Shielded by an impenetrable layer of lava rock and surrounded by a 128,000 acre exclusion zone, the Spring
                                    is constantly replenished by a gradual filtration of rainfall and snowmelt over uninhabited and untouched lava fields. With over 900,000 cubic meters of water overflowing from the &Ouml;lfus Spring into the ocean every
                                    day, it's one of the world's largest natural springs.</p>

                                <p>Icelandic Glacial&trade; takes immense pride in running a completely sustainable operation fueled entirely by geothermal and hydroelectric power. At 7,688 sq. ft., the world class facility is one of the world's greenest
                                    and cleanest. Fully automated and hands-free, the facility is capable of producing up to 30,000 bottles per hour. The filling process takes place in a clean room environment held to the highest laboratory standards.
                                    The water for Icelandic Glacial&trade; travels directly from the underground spring into the bottling facility, which maintains a positive air pressure to impede the outside air. The first time Icelandic Glacial&trade;
                                    encounters the open air is when the bottle seal is broken. Nothing is ever added or taken away.&nbsp;</p>
